Hi, I am currently pursuing my PhD under [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/) at the [Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg](https://www.uni-freiburg.de/) advised by [Prof. Thomas Brox](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/brox/index.en.html). My research is centered on rethinking and advancing our understanding of intelligence, with the goal of aligning AI agents with this broader vision towards intelligence beyond imitation. 

I focus equally on abstract theoretical challenges and their practical implications, particularly in the domains of reinforcement learning, world models, and representation learning, with an emphasis on their application in life sciences and embodied AI. 

My academic journey includes a Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Freiburg, where I was fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Frank Hutter](https://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/profile/hutter/).

My work spans a broad spectrum, from developing generative algorithms for RNA structure prediction to exploring the intersection of causality and generalization in AI models. I am particularly committed to the democratization of AI, ensuring that it's accessible and beneficial across diverse applications and cultures.

Outside of research, I enjoy reading, the beach, basketball, weight lifting, kite-surfing, and learning new sports. I'm always eager to discuss research, life, and everything in between. If you're interested, I’d love to connect!
